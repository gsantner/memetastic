## FAQ

### General

#### Where are Memes saved?
MemeTastic creates a folder »Pictures»memetastic»memes in your device storage for you. All memes will be saved to this location. The advantage is that you can view images with any other gallery or file manager app too. Also, if you uninstall MemeTastic images don't get deleted.

#### How to view created Memes?
After creating & saving a meme you can use the built in image viewer. You can find the image viewer on MemeTastic's main screen at the "Saved" tab. There you can view all created memes. As memes ares saved to your storage Pictures folder, you can view images with any other gallery or file manager app too.

#### How to suggest fonts and templates for addition to MemeTastic?
Please leave a comment here or on the [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/gsantner/memetastic/issues/126) with the respective font(s) and image(s).

Notice: Assets are only accepeted if they are under a free license (or public domain). Pictures from movies, series and most of those you see on sites like 9GAG are very likely not free.

#### What does "free" refer to?
Both, free as in beer and free as in freedom. For more information, see [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd) (software) and [Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses) (media).


### Meme Templates

#### Which templates are preinstalled?
When you install MemeTastic you will only find assets that are under a free license or under public domain. Images that get memes or meme templates are usually under copyright and fair use is a legal gray area. For that reason, MemeTastic does not bundle non-free images.

You can find the current list of bundled fonts at [GitHub](https://github.com/gsantner/memetastic/tree/master/app/src/main/assets/bundled).
